# Sim World to Real World: Track Design and Performance App

## Overview
Welcome to the **Sim World to Real World** app! This application bridges the gap between virtual simulation and real-world performance tracking. With our app, users can design routes using real-world roads via Apple Maps, create personalized tracks, and monitor their performance through detailed timing and split analysis. Whether you're a driver, cyclist, or runner, our app provides insights to help you improve your speed, consistency, and overall performance.

- **Split Timing:** Each turn and segment is individually timed for granular performance insights.
- **Progress Delta:** Compare your current timing with previous attempts to track improvements.

### **Real-Time Feedback**
- Visual cues and audio notifications for upcoming turns and checkpoints.
- On-the-go split updates to keep you informed during your activity.

### **Performance Analytics**
- Historical data for each route, including best times, average speeds, and split breakdowns.
- Graphical representation of performance deltas over multiple attempts.
- Export performance data for further analysis.
